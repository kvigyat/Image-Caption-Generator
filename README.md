# Image-Caption-Generator
I have developed an automated Image caption generator model using VGG16 and LSTM using Flickr8k dataset. The objective is to predict the caption for the input image which can be useful for the visually imapired persons. BLEU Score is used as a metric to evaluate the performance of the trained model.
